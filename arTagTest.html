      Tag being used here is 'tag1.png' and is a 3-by-3 April Tag generated from this site:
      https://au.gmented.com/app/marker/marker.php

      They call these markers "barcodes" (not the 1d kind but the 2d kind, i.e. QR Codes)

      It's not clear what the "code" means, i.e. where value='1' below, that's the "code" that was 
      set when the tag was generated. This value can range from 0 to 63.
